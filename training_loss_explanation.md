# Understanding Training Loss for Your GPT Model

This document explains the current training loss observed (around 3.9 after 3000 optimizer steps) and provides guidance on how to achieve a lower loss for your custom GPT model pre-trained on Wikitext-103.

## Is a Loss of 3.9 After 3000 Iterations Normal?

Yes, a loss of approximately 3.9 after 3000 optimizer steps (iterations) is **plausible and normal for the very early stages of training** a GPT model with a vocabulary size of 32,000 on the Wikitext-103 dataset.

Here's why:
*   **Initial Random Loss:** Before any training, a randomly initialized model will have a loss close to `ln(vocab_size)`. For `vocab_size = 32000`, this is `ln(32000) ≈ 10.37`.
*   **Learning Progress:** A drop from ~10.37 to 3.9 clearly indicates that the model has started learning patterns from the data.
*   **Fraction of an Epoch:** The Wikitext-103 dataset is quite large. Let's calculate how much of the data 3000 optimizer steps represents:
    *   Your `BLOCK_SIZE` is 1024.
    *   The `TextDataset` creates `len(self.tokens) - self.block_size` samples. With `116,944,985` tokens, this is `116,944,985 - 1024 = 116,943,961` possible training samples (sequences).
    *   Your `BATCH_SIZE` is 4.
    *   Your `GRADIENT_ACCUMULATION_STEPS` is 8.
    *   Number of raw batches per epoch = `num_samples / BATCH_SIZE = 116,943,961 / 4 ≈ 29,235,990` batches.
    *   Number of optimizer steps per epoch = `raw_batches_per_epoch / GRADIENT_ACCUMULATION_STEPS = 29,235,990 / 8 ≈ 3,654,498` optimizer steps.
    *   This means **3000 optimizer steps is only about `3000 / 3,654,498 ≈ 0.082%` of a single pass (epoch)** over the Wikitext-103 training data.
    *   Therefore, the model has seen a very small fraction of the dataset. Significant loss reduction requires processing much more data.

## What is an "Ideal" Loss?

There isn't a fixed "ideal" loss value, as it's highly dependent on several factors:

*   **Model Architecture and Size:** Larger and more complex models generally have the capacity to achieve lower loss values on the same dataset. Your model (`n_layer=12, n_head=12, n_embd=768`) is a moderately sized GPT model.
*   **Dataset Characteristics:** The size, quality, and complexity of the training dataset are crucial. Wikitext-103 is a standard benchmark.
*   **Training Duration and Compute Resources:** More extensive training (more epochs or iterations) typically leads to lower loss, up to a point where the model might start to overfit or returns diminish.
*   **Evaluation Metric:** Loss is one metric. Perplexity (`exp(loss)`) is often reported for language models. A lower loss corresponds to lower perplexity, indicating the model is less "surprised" by the next token.

For a model of your architecture on Wikitext-103, with sufficient and effective training, you might aim for a training loss that eventually drops into the **low 3s or even high 2s**. For example:
*   Loss of 3.0 ≈ Perplexity of 20
*   Loss of 2.8 ≈ Perplexity of 16.4

## How to Achieve a Lower Loss

To significantly reduce the training loss and improve your model's performance, consider the following strategies:

1.  **Train Significantly Longer:**
    *   **This is the most critical factor.** As calculated above, 3000 iterations is a very small start.
    *   **Increase `NUM_EPOCHS`:** In [`pretrain_gpt.py`](pretrain_gpt.py:25), change `NUM_EPOCHS = 1` to a larger value (e.g., 3, 5, 10, or even more). Each epoch will take a considerable amount of time.
    *   **Use `MAX_ITERS`:** Alternatively, comment out `NUM_EPOCHS` and set `MAX_ITERS` (e.g., in [`pretrain_gpt.py`](pretrain_gpt.py:26)) to a much larger number, such as 50,000, 100,000, 200,000, or more. This gives you finer control over the total number of optimizer updates.

2.  **Implement a Learning Rate Schedule:**
    *   A constant learning rate (like your current `LEARNING_RATE = 3e-4`) is a good starting point, but a dynamic learning rate often yields better results.
    *   **Common strategy:**
        *   **Warmup:** Start with a very small learning rate and linearly increase it to your target learning rate over a certain number of initial iterations (e.g., a few thousand). This helps stabilize training early on.
        *   **Decay:** After the warmup phase, gradually decrease the learning rate. A popular choice is a cosine decay schedule, where the learning rate follows a cosine curve down to a very small value or zero by the end of training.
    *   This requires modifying the training loop in [`pretrain_gpt.py`](pretrain_gpt.py:1) to adjust `optimizer.param_groups[0]['lr']` at each step.

3.  **Hyperparameter Tuning (Experimentation):**
    *   **Learning Rate:** While `3e-4` is standard for AdamW with transformers, the optimal value can vary. If using a schedule, the peak learning rate is important.
    *   **Batch Size / Gradient Accumulation:** Your current effective batch size is `BATCH_SIZE * GRADIENT_ACCUMULATION_STEPS = 4 * 8 = 32` sequences. Larger effective batch sizes (e.g., 256, 512, or even 1024 sequences, which means `262144`, `524288` tokens if `block_size=1024`) are often beneficial for language model pre-training, leading to more stable gradients and potentially better final performance. You are limited by VRAM for `BATCH_SIZE`, but you can increase `GRADIENT_ACCUMULATION_STEPS` further (e.g., to 16, 32, 64). This will increase the time per optimizer step but might improve training dynamics.
    *   **Weight Decay:** `0.1` is a common value for AdamW.

4.  **Use a Validation Set:**
    *   Currently, the script only monitors training loss. To get a true measure of how well your model generalizes to unseen data and to detect overfitting, you should create a validation split from your `wikitext-103_train_corpus.txt`.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Split your corpus (e.g., 95% for training, 5% for validation).
        2.  Create a separate `TextDataset` and `DataLoader` for the validation set.
        3.  Periodically (e.g., every `EVAL_INTERVAL`), run an evaluation loop on the validation set (model in `eval()` mode, no gradient calculations).
        4.  Log the validation loss.
        5.  Save the `best_model.pt` based on the **lowest validation loss** achieved, not just training loss. This helps prevent saving overfit models.

5.  **Model Architecture Tweaks (Advanced):**
    *   For a given dataset and compute budget, there might be more optimal model dimensions (layers, heads, embedding size), but your current configuration is a reasonable starting point similar to smaller GPT-2/3 style models.

**Recommendation for Immediate Next Steps:**

The most impactful change you can make right now is to **train for a substantially longer period**. Aim to complete at least one full epoch, and ideally several, by adjusting `NUM_EPOCHS` or `MAX_ITERS`. Monitor the loss; you should see it continue to decrease significantly with more training.

After that, consider implementing a learning rate schedule and a validation set for more robust training and model selection.
